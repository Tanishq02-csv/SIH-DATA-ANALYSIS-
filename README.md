📊 Data Analysis and Visualization on SIH Dataset
📌 Overview
This project presents an in-depth data analysis and visualization of the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) dataset, focusing on the following datasets:

Problem Statement Dataset 📄
Wildcard Teams Dataset 🎟️
Grand Finale Teams Dataset 🏆
Winning Teams Dataset 🥇
The objective of this analysis is to derive meaningful insights from the data, exploring team performance, participation trends, and key factors influencing success in SIH.

🛠️ Analysis & Insights
Our data-driven approach includes:

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution of teams across different categories.
📈 Visualizations: Graphs, charts, and plots for trend analysis.
🔍 Comparative Study: Evaluating wildcard teams vs. directly selected teams and their performance in the grand finale.
🏅 Winning Factors: Identifying key traits of successful teams in SIH.
A detailed work report has been prepared, summarizing the findings and key inferences about the teams and their performance.

🏆 Key Takeaways
How teams progress from initial selection to winning the hackathon.
The impact of wildcard entries in the competition.
Patterns in winning teams based on various factors.
This project serves as a valuable resource for future SIH participants, researchers, and data enthusiasts interested in hackathon trends.
