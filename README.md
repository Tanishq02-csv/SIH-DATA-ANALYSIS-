# 📊 Data Analysis and Visualization on SIH Dataset  

## 📌 Overview  
This project presents an in-depth **data analysis and visualization** of the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) dataset**, focusing on the following datasets:  

- **Problem Statement Dataset** 📄  
- **Wildcard Teams Dataset** 🎟️  
- **Grand Finale Teams Dataset** 🏆  
- **Winning Teams Dataset** 🥇  

The objective of this analysis is to derive meaningful insights from the data, exploring team performance, participation trends, and key factors influencing success in SIH.

## 🛠️ Analysis & Insights  
Our data-driven approach includes:  

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the distribution of teams across different categories.  
- 📈 **Visualizations**: Graphs, charts, and plots for trend analysis.  
- 🔍 **Comparative Study**: Evaluating **wildcard teams vs. directly selected teams** and their performance in the grand finale.  
- 🏅 **Winning Factors**: Identifying key traits of **successful teams** in SIH.  

A **detailed work report** has been prepared, summarizing the findings and key inferences about the teams and their performance.
